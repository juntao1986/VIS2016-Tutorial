\noindent\textbf{\textit{Expressive Flow Field Exploration}}\\
\textbf{Jun Tao}
\paragraph{Abstract}
A major task of visualizing steady flow fields is to allow users perceive the flow patterns and locate features of interest. Traditional flow visualization approaches, such as \emph{seed placement} and \emph{streamline selection}, generate an appropriate set of streamlines to describe steady flow fields. However, only limited capabilities are provided to meet specific needs from different users, especially at the streamline segment level. In this talk, I will start from a unified framework that automatically selects best streamlines to display and selects best viewpoint to observe them simultaneously. Then, three interactive techniques will be presented to demonstrate the benefit of interactive exploration, including a graph-based technique to capture the relations among streamlines and spatial regions, a deformation framework to achieve focus+context visualization, and a vocabulary approach to query flow patterns in a textual manner.

\paragraph{Contribution}
This part of the tutorial focuses on the exploration of steady flow fields. Through the presented techniques, two trends of flow visualization are shown. First, user interactions are highly involved. This allows users to specify, identify and observe their interested patterns/features in a more desired way. Second, features are captured at both coarser and finer levels. Unlike most of the early works that treat each streamline as an entity, more local features residing on segments of streamlines can be compared, matched and discovered as well.

\section*{TUTORIAL NOTES}
The tutorial notes will consist of the description of the tutorial, copies of the slides for each talk, and an extensive bibliography including specific references used in the tutorial as well as a general selection of relevant references.
