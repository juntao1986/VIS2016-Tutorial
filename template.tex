\noindent\textbf{\textit{Spatio-temporal Flow Analysis}}\\
\textbf{Tino Weinkauf}
\paragraph{Abstract}
Understanding the processes in time-dependent flows is of crucial importance in many domains. Different methods exist for this purpose. This talk reviews methods that build on a spatio-temporal concept where the temporal dimension is treated on equal footing with the spatial dimensions. This means, an n-dimensional unsteady flow is analyzed as an (n+1)-dimensional steady flow. This has led to a number of powerful analysis and visualization methods in the last decade such as Feature Flow Fields \cite{theisel03b, weinkauf11b}, Swirling Motion Cores \cite{weinkauf07c}, Streak Lines as Tangent Curves \cite{weinkauf10c, weinkauf12a}, and more. The talk will cover the range from theoretical foundations to the applications on real data.

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Feature Extraction, Feature Tracking and Feature Simplification with Robustness}}\\
\textbf{Bei Wang}
\paragraph{Abstract}
This talk will review topological approaches for flow visualization. In particular, we will discuss a recent line of research that spans feature extraction, feature tracking, and feature simplification of vector fields based upon the topological notion of robustness that captures structural stability of the data. Robustness, a concept similar to persistent homology, quantifies the stability of critical points with respect to the minimum amount of
perturbation in the fields required to remove them. We will discuss how this line of work can potentially increase the interpretability of data, specifically, by giving a coherent and multi-scale view of the flow dynamics under both stationary and time-varying settings. We will demonstrate how robustness-based approaches are independent of the topological skeleton and are scalable to large-scale datasets.

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Expressive Flow Field Exploration}}\\
\textbf{Jun Tao}
\paragraph{Abstract}
A major task of visualizing steady flow fields is to allow users perceive the flow patterns and locate features of interest. Traditional flow visualization approaches, such as \emph{seed placement} and \emph{streamline selection}, generate an appropriate set of streamlines to describe steady flow fields. However, only limited capabilities are provided to meet specific needs from different users, especially at the streamline segment level. In this talk, I will start from a unified framework that automatically selects best streamlines to display and selects best viewpoint to observe them simultaneously. Then, three interactive techniques will be presented to demonstrate the benefit of interactive exploration, including a graph-based technique to capture the relations among streamlines and spatial regions, a deformation framework to achieve focus+context visualization, and a vocabulary approach to query flow patterns in a textual manner.

\paragraph{Contribution}
This part of the tutorial focuses on the exploration of steady flow fields. Through the presented techniques, two trends of flow visualization are shown. First, user interactions are highly involved. This allows users to specify, identify and observe their interested patterns/features in a more desired way. Second, features are captured at both coarser and finer levels. Unlike most of the early works that treat each streamline as an entity, more local features residing on segments of streamlines can be compared, matched and discovered as well.

\section*{TUTORIAL NOTES}
The tutorial notes will consist of the description of the tutorial, copies of the slides for each talk, and an extensive bibliography including specific references used in the tutorial as well as a general selection of relevant references.
