\section*{ABSTRACT}
Flow visualization has been a central topic in scientific visualization for many years, which can be explained by the ubiquity of vector fields in various kinds of scientific, engineering, medical researches. In all these domains, with today's ever-growing computation power, numerical simulations produce large, time-varying and highly complex vector fields. Preserving the rich information in these large and complex vector fields and presenting concise visualizations for clarity are two desired goals, but they are often conflicting. Striking a balance between them is challenging, which requires us to better distinguish the features from the contexts. Understanding and extracting features become critical to obtain insights from the vector fields with growing sizes and complexities.

This tutorial reviews different approaches that all focus on highlighting features in complex data sets. The first talk focuses on methods that exploit user knowledge to specify and observe features. Putting the user in the loop provides maximum flexibility, yet some automatisms are required to scale with the feature complexity. Such methods are discussed in the second and third talk, where feature extraction, tracking and quantification are the core topics. The methods aim at drastically reducing the amount of information by condensing the data set to a coherent feature skeleton. The fourth and fifth talk focus on two forms of large-scale data: high-fidelity flow simulations and ensemble simulations. High-fidelity flow simulations produce amounts of data exceeding storage capabilities and necessitate in-situ visualization methods. Ensemble simulations have the added complexity of uncertainty that needs to be addressed with scalable methods.

\section*{LEVEL}
Intermediate/Advanced.

\section*{PREREQUISITE}
A general understanding of flow fields and flow visualization, including basic concepts and techniques, such as different kinds of field lines, critical points, and particle tracing, etc.

% \section*{AUDIENCE}
% The intended audience includes students, researchers and practitioners who are interested in the recent advances in flow visualization. More details to be added.

\section*{DESCRIPTION}
The description and outline of each topic are presented as the followings:

\addverticalspace

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Expressive Flow Field Exploration}}\\
\textbf{Jun Tao}
\paragraph{Abstract}
A major task of visualizing steady flow fields is to allow users perceive the flow patterns and locate features of interest. Traditional flow visualization approaches, such as seed placement and streamline selection, generate an appropriate set of streamlines to describe steady flow fields. However, only limited capabilities are provided to meet specific needs from different users, especially at the streamline segment level. In this talk, we will start from an automatic streamline and viewpoint selection framework, and then introduce three interactive exploration approaches. We demonstrate that the transition from the automatic approaches to the interactive ones provides more flexibility that allows users to specify, identify and observe their interested patterns/features in a more desired way.

\addverticalspace

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Spatio-temporal Flow Analysis}}\\
\textbf{Tino Weinkauf}
\paragraph{Abstract}
Understanding the processes in time-dependent flows is of crucial importance in many domains. Different methods exist for this purpose. This talk reviews methods that build on a spatio-temporal concept where the temporal dimension is treated on equal footing with the spatial dimensions. This means, an n-dimensional unsteady flow is analyzed as an (n+1)-dimensional steady flow. This has led to a number of powerful analysis and visualization methods in the last decade such as Feature Flow Fields \cite{theisel03b, weinkauf11b}, Swirling Motion Cores \cite{weinkauf07c}, Streak Lines as Tangent Curves \cite{weinkauf10c, weinkauf12a}, and more. The talk will cover the range from theoretical foundations to the applications on real data.

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Flow Analysis with Robustness}}\\
\textbf{Bei Wang}
\paragraph{Abstract}
This talk will review topological approaches for flow visualization. In particular, we will discuss a recent line of research that spans feature extraction, feature tracking, and feature simplification of vector fields based upon the topological notion of robustness that captures structural stability of the data. Robustness, a concept similar to persistent homology, quantifies the stability of critical points with respect to the minimum amount of perturbation in the fields required to remove them. We will discuss how this line of work can potentially increase the interpretability of data, specifically, by giving a coherent and multi-scale view of the flow dynamics under both stationary and time-varying settings. We will demonstrate how robustness-based approaches are independent of the topological skeleton and are scalable to large-scale datasets.

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Vector Field Techniques for Large-Scale Data}}\\
\textbf{Christoph Garth}
\paragraph{Abstract}
Large-scale vector fields as arising from modern scientific computing and experimental workflows pose substantial and significant challenges to visualization. While there is a rich body of work addressing flow visualization, many methods are unable to scale to modern data set sizes both algorithmically and with respect to the complexity of the obtained results. In his talk, he will discuss the application of flow visualization techniques to large-scale, time-varying vector fields, and report on recent research results in this area. Particular attention will be given to parallel algorithms and in-situ techniques that eschew the requirement to store full-fidelity data to achieve accurate visualization. On the latter topic, the talk will discuss several methods to flexibly analyse vector field data at reduced resolution. To conclude, recent results for large-scale vector field ensembles will be discussed.

\addverticalspace

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Scalable Ensemble and Uncertain Flow Field Visualization}}\\
\textbf{Hanqi Guo}
\paragraph{Abstract}
This talk covers both theoritical foundations and scalability studies in ensemble and uncertain flow visualization. As the growth of computation powers, scientists can generate ensembles of flow simulations, or flows with uncertainties, but it remains a great challenge to visualize and understand such data. First, features in flow visualization, such as FTLE and LCS, must be redefined for ensemble and uncertain flows. We review the traditional and direct visualization techniques, as well as advances in this topic, such as coupled field line tracing and analysis in numerical ensembles, comparative ensemble flow visualization, and the the measurement of flow divergence in uncertain unsteady flows. Second, the analysis of uncertain and ensemble and uncertain flows require scalability. We review the scalable algorithms to advect particles in ensemble and uncertain flows, because they play the central role in flow analysis and consumes majority computation time. New techniques in flow data management and stochastic particle tracing are covered, which can help scientists analyze ensemble and uncertain flows at scale.
