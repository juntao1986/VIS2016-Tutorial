              by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady
              flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally
              gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce
              a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in
              unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path
              lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over
              time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations
              where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them,
              we show how to re-formulate the problem using the Parallel Vectors
              operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields.},

              all these lines can be obtained by a simple integration of an autonomous
              ODE system. Our approach draws on the principal ideas of the recently
              introduced tangent curve description of streak lines. We provide

              vector field, which could previously only be constructed in a geometric
              manner. Furthermore, our scheme gives rise to new types of curves.
              In particular, we introduce advected stream lines as a parameter-free
              variant of the time line metaphor. With our novel mathematical description

  abstract = {Characteristic curves of vector fields include stream, path, and streak
              lines. Stream and path lines can be obtained by a simple vector field
              integration of an autonomous ODE system, i.e., they can be described
              as tangent curves of a vector field. This facilitates their mathematical
              analysis including the extraction of core lines around which stream
              or path lines exhibit swirling motion, or the computation of their
              curvature for every point in the domain without actually integrating
              them. Such a description of streak lines is not yet available, which
              excludes them from most of the feature extraction and analysis tools
              that have been developed in our community. In this paper, we develop
              the first description of streak lines as tangent curves of a derived
              vector field -- the streak line vector field -- and show how it can
              be computed from the spatial and temporal gradients of the flow map,
              i.e., a dense path line integration is required. We demonstrate the
              high accuracy of our approach by comparing it to solutions where
              the ground truth is analytically known and to solutions where the
              ground truth has been obtained using the classic streak line computation.
              Furthermore, we apply a number of feature extraction and analysis
              tools to the new streak line vector field including the extraction
              of cores of swirling streak lines and the computation of streak line
              curvature fields. These first applications foreshadow the large variety
              of possible future research directions based on our new mathematical

  abstract = {Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted approach for extracting and
              tracking features. In particular, they are often used to track critical
              points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and track vortex
              core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal
              evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector field
              -- the so-called Feature Flow Field (FFF). Hence, the desired feature
              line is a stream line of the FFF. As we will carefully analyze in
              this paper, the stream lines around this feature line may diverge
              from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves
              slightly off the feature line due to numerical errors, then it will
              be captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the
              real feature line. The goal of this paper is to define a new FFF
              with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always
              converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of
              numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature
              line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration.
              This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate
              than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable FFF
              formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points
              and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to
              a number of data sets.},

abstract = {We present an implicit method for globally computing all four classic
types of integral surfaces -- stream, path, streak, and time surfaces
-- in 3D time-dependent vector fields. Our novel formulation is based
on the representation of a time surface as implicit isosurface of
a 3D scalar function advected by the flow field. The evolution of
a time surface is then given as an isovolume in 4D space-time spanned
by a series of advected scalar functions. Based on this, the other
three integral surfaces are described as the intersection of two
isovolumes derived from different scalar functions. Our method uses
a dense flow integration to compute integral surfaces globally in
the entire domain. This allows to change the seeding structure efficiently
by simply defining new isovalues. We propose two rendering methods
that exploit the implicit nature of our integral surfaces: 4D raycasting,
and projection into a 3D volume. Furthermore, we present a marching
cubes inspired surface extraction method to convert the implicit
surface representation to an explicit triangle mesh. In contrast
to previous approaches for implicit stream surfaces, our method allows
for multiple voxel intersections, covers all regions of the flow
field, and provides full control over the seeding line within the
entire domain.},
